# Odin Calculator
This project marks the culmination of my journey through the foundations of The Odin Project. To be honest, I've been away from programming for about 40 days, so I might need a bit of time to get back into the groove. My aim is to complete this within two weeks, though.

Okay, so let's talk about using Git. I've finally decided to start recording my progress with it. It was a bit of a hassle, but I managed to get it done. I might not act like I'm fully into it, but who knows, maybe I'll embrace it more in the next project.

## About the Calculator
The calculator project seemed simple in theory, but it turned out to be quite challenging for me, considering my relative newness to programming. The HTML and CSS layout were straightforward; I replicated a random calculator image from the internet and tweaked the CSS a bit. That part was easy.

The real struggle began with the JavaScript functionality. I had no idea where to start and got stuck for almost a week. I thought about it at school, at home, and almost everywhere. I even considered moving on with the curriculum, thinking I might be spending too much time on this. I watched YouTube videos, but most of them used the eval() function, which was against the advice.

After much contemplation, things started to click, and you can see the result in the code. It was a frustrating experience, but I'm proud that I persevered and managed to pull it off. Despite being a simple app, it's a stepping stone, and I'm eager to tackle more complex projects.

## Back After 9 Months
Well, I'm back after a hiatus of 9 months (according to GitHub). Obviously, I've forgotten a bit, but I thought, why not give this project another shot? It should be easier this time around with a better understanding and some improved problem-solving skills.

well yeah I found a probable improvement I used flexbox in the one I did previously but it more logical to use grid as someone said " if its one directinoal use flexbox , if its 2 directions use grid "

changed the older design for a neumorphism design " tho people say its bad for visual impariments " but well i did it and not going to change it
