# odin-Calculator
this is the last project in foundations from the odin project 

to be honest i have no idea how to do this currently i also left programming for about 40 days so i kidna forgot the basics so i might take a while tho i wont spend more then 2 weeks on this 


okay so i should really start doing this git thing to record what i am doing but whatever i did it and i am not going to act as if i am doing it maybe next project 


the calculator was fairly simple in theory well maybe it is simple anyway but i am new to this and kinda stupid so who cares it felt hard as heck 

the html and css layout was straight forwrad i just took a random calculator photo from the internet and replecated it with some tweaking on the css but it was easy 

the hard part was the javascript functionality which is very annoying i didnt have any idea i got stuck on this for like almost a week i thought of it in school and out of school 
finally i kinda gave up on it and even thought about continuing with the curriculum because maybe i am wasting my time on the project too much i even looked up videos on youtube 
but guess what most of them were using the eval() function which they said not to use 

anyway after thinking about it alot it kinda started coming and well you can see it in the code 

it was frustrating but i am proud of myself that i was able to do it and i like it even tho its a simple app i am looking forward to make more and much complicated stuff
